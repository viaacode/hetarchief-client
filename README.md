## Deploy

Follow Slite doc: https://studiohyperdrive.slite.com/app/docs/L0Alk6HWq5w7il

### Branching model

Important in the deployment flow is the branching model. Ours differs a bit from the official docs but it changes
nothing to the deploy flow.  
Below you can find an explanation and example of each branch:

**Feature**:

Used for creating new features or refactoring. Usually associated with a Task issue in Jira.  
If this is the case don't forget to include the correct ticket number in the branch.

_example_: `feature/ARC-1-button-component`, `feature/update-readme`

**Bugfix**:

Used for fixing bugs that arise during development or after testing. Usually associated with a bug issue in Jira.  
If this is the case don't forget to include the correct ticket number in the branch.

_example_: `bugfix/ARC-1-button-component`, `bugfix/typo-in-readme`

**Release**:

Used during development to mark the next release we will be deploying to QAS and PRD.  
Release branches should be merged periodically to develop.

_example_: `release/v1.0.0`

**Develop**:

Used for deploying to the TST environment.  
Opening PR's to develop will also perform several checks to make sure code is passing all tests and the build doesn't
fail.

_branch name_: `develop`

**Master**:

Used for deploying to the QAS environment.  
Opening PR's to master will also perform several checks to make sure code is passing all tests and the build doesn't
fail.  
Pushing a tag to master will deploy to PRD.

_branch name_: `master`

## Environment variables

This project uses environemnt variables. For local development, these can be found in the
`.env.template` file in the root of the project.  
Create your own `.env.local` file here with the correct values to get started. Contact one of the active developers
listed below for access to these values.

They are provided through the `env_file` property in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
